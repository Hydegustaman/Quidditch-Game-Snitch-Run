Now, about this project. 

I call it # Quidditch-Game-Snitch-Run #
You are an 80's or 90's generation kid? Then you must be familiar with the Harry Potter character from JK Rowling's novel series. Now, one of the elements of Potter World, that is Quidditch games, being re-enacted once again in this simple JavaScript game.
Basic play : you are playing the Snitch Ball, a winged-golden ball that flyinng from left to the right of the screenplay.
Use arrow key (Up, Down, Left and Right) from your keyboards to move the Snitch reach the finish line (black and white area),
Avoid bumped to brick line (brown area), or you'll be starting from the left again, there're also the countdown-timer,
you'll be lost one life everytime the timer reach zero (0). So, speed up the Snitch moves and level up.

Have A Nice Day!!
